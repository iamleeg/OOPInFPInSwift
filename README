# OOPInFPInSwift

This is a collection of playgrounds in which object-oriented
programming is built out of functions in Swift. It supplants
[Objective-Swift](https://github.com/iamleeg/Objective-Swift), which
was written such a long time ago (two years) that everything is broken
and horrible. LOL computers.

These playgrounds were made in Xcode 9, so if WWDC 2018 has already
happened you probably can't use these any more either.

## Usage

Load the playgrounds in Xcode. They have descriptive comments.
